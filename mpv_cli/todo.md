   üîç How System.cmd/3 Works
In Elixir, this function:

```bash
System.cmd("mpv", ["--no-video", url], stderr_to_stdout: true)
```

does not spawn a subprocess that you control in real-time. It:

- Spawns an OS process (mpv)
- Waits until mpv exits
- Collects all output (stdout and stderr) after it‚Äôs done
- Returns {output, exit_code}
